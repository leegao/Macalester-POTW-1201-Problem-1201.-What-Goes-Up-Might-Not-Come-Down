A random walk on the 2-dimensional integer lattice begins at the origin. At each step, the walker moves one unit either left, right, or up, each with probability $\frac13$. (No downward steps ever.) A walk is a success if it reaches the point $(1,1)$. What is the probability of success?

Note: One can vary the problem by varying the target point. Eg., use $(1, 0)$ or $(0,1)$ instead. Perhaps there is a good method to resolve the general case of target $(a, b)$.
